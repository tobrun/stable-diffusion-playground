# Stable Diffusion Playground

Welcome to my Stable Diffusion Playground! This project is designed as an exploratory project for anyone interested in diving into the capabilities, techniques, and applications of stable diffusion models. Inspired by the insightful YouTube tutorials of [Sebastian Kamph](https://www.youtube.com/@sebastiankamph), this playground serves as a documentation and learning hub for both beginners and advanced enthusiasts in the field of AI art generation and manipulation.

## About Stable Diffusion

Stable diffusion is a state-of-the-art deep learning model that generates high-quality images from textual descriptions. It represents a significant breakthrough in AI, offering unparalleled flexibility and creativity in content creation. This project aims to explore the depths of stable diffusion, experimenting with various prompts, settings, and modifications to uncover the full potential of this technology.

## Project Structure

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:tobrun/stable-diffusion-playground.git
    ```

2. Install Stable Diffusion Web GUIs.

    2.1 [StableSwarmUI](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableSwarmUI): 
    - easy-to-use
    - great starting point for Stable Diffusion
    - limited controlnet support

    2.2 [AUTOMATIC1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
    - most feature rich UI
    - hard to understand at first glance

3. Go throught the various markdown documents covering specific use-cases.
